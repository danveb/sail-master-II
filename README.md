# Sail-Master II 

## Description 

Sail-Master II is an application for sailors and water sportsâ€™ enthusiasts that have a common goal to share the joy in sailing. This app lets users know if sailing conditions based on current wind parameters are appropriate to enjoy a day out on the water. Happy Sailing! 

## Tech Stack 

- Front End: JavaScript/React.js 
- Back End: Node/Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Mechanics: 

We welcome new and existing users to the app. In the navbar there will be an option to login and signup/register. If users have registered before they will be able to click on login and access the Login form for authentication. Else new users will need to register for full app access. 

Users will be able to create their own voyage from start-to-end points (from predetermined yacht clubs). Users can then click on the newly created journey for details and weather conditions. Weather API will provide current temperature, humidity, precipitation, visibility and wind parameters. Finally, sailing advice will be given to users based on weather conditions (primarily wind). 

A list of sailing houses are populated by default. Users can view key information such as latitude/longitude and websites for further communication with each club.
